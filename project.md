### Baseball Analysis & Visualization - (with Abram, Chris, Matt, Jay) - March 2017

- Baseball dataset analysis (mainly a WAR score of batters in 2016). By conducting a correlation analysis and feature selection, we learned what attributes are most influential on calculating a WAR score and found lots of interesting insights from data. Furthermore, we utilized diverse visualization techniques such as Tableau, R, and D3.

### Crime Prediction - (with Abram and Chris) - May 2016

- Loaded and preprocess a huge data set(more than 5m rows)
- Explored the data set using multiple methods such as Pandas and Seaborn.
- Used the attributes such as longitude, latitude, crime type, crime time, crime date, crime street, etc. to create a probabilistic or predictive model that recommends caution when in certain areas of Chicago at certain times. Initial emphasis will be on armed and strongarm robberies in the Chicago area. 
- Implemented an application using Python Flask web framework.
- Mainly focused on figuring out the probabilities of whether people who committed certain crimes were arrested.

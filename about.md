## Brief introduction about Simon
My real name is Sungmin. I don't mind being called 'Sungmin', but I made up my nickname as Simon. Please feel free to call me Simon. FYI, I'm originally from South Korea (sometimes I ought to specify which part of Korea I was born since occasionally people ask me 'Are you from North or South?'). 

I'm an enthusiastic Data Scientist and would love to explore diverse field of interests. I love to collect data at any cost and analyze them to gain potential insights and discover hidden values. As one of the frequently mentioned buzzword 'Big Data', my passion toward Big Data is keep growing as time goes by and the more data I acquire and glance at them the busier I will be due to the bulk of data preprocessing and implementations I need to process.

My main interests are Healthcare, Food Consumption, Consultant, Sport(especially Baseball). No doubt a lot of people including myself are interested in longevity according to improved sanitary facilities and medicine development and so on. Intuitively it is very straightforward for us to decide what factors we consider to live longer, but in order to gain comprehensive understanding of those factors we need data. Data collection and analysis are what I enjoy myself a lot. 

Data exist everywhere, either visible or invisible, and I strongly believe data are essential to our life. Given the data, what Machine Learning/Deep Learning models we need to design, what data storage platform we need to run, how we draw such a brilliant conclusion, are what all Data Scientist must consider.

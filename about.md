## Brief introduction about Simon
My real name is Sungmin. I don't mind being called 'Sungmin', but I made up my nickname as Simon. Please feel free to call me Simon. FYI, I'm originally from South Korea (sometimes I ought to specify which part of Korea I was born since occasionally people ask me 'Are you from North or South?'). I'm an enthusiastic Data Scientist and would love to explore diverse field of interests. 
I love to collect data at any cost and analyze them to gain potential insights and discover hidden values. As one of the frequently mentioned buzzword 'Big Data', my passion toward Big Data is keep growing as time goes by and the more data I acquire and glance at them the busier I will be due to the bulk of data preprocessing and implementations I need to process.
